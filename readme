Django STRIKE
About
Django STRIKE is an app meant to be enjoyed by users all over the globe 
from ages 13 and up. App functionality is most aptly described as a live 
version of the classic game Battleship. Users will be able to log in and 
mark their location as a base, from where they may shoot at randomly 
generated targets, given by longitude and latitude coordinates. Users are 
given 10 random coordinates at a time, and once they successfully hit a target, 
it is removed from their collection while the player earns points. In order to 
successfully destroy a target, the user will enter parameters such as initial 
velocity/power and projection angle. The user may continue to shoot until 
((ICE)Optionally, a user may also see the coordinates of other friends' bases, 
and may purchase extra game features to be able to shoot at those targets.)

Pitch Presentation

Future Enhancements
In the future, this game would ideally give players the ability 
to choose the weapon they want to shoot with, be able to buy new weapons,
 and also shoot at their friends' bases instead of choosing random targets.
